# Dotty Reporter for Mocha

Dotty is a dot-and-summary reporter for the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test runner. It displays a running line of dots (`.`) for passing tests, with `F`'s and `*`s representing failures and skipped tests respectively. A summary of failed and skipped tests is presented at the end. It is roughly equivalent to (the progress formatter)[https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/2-4/docs/command-line/format-option] for [RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/).

Dotty is not yet released. Watch this space.
